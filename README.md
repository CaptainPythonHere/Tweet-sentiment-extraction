 Twitter Sentiment Analysis with Machine Learning
# Introduction

# Scope

In the times where hate across social media platforms has visibly increased and
triggered debates on mental health, we believe such an analysis will allow people to
recognize wheater the tweets on an account are on the negative or positive side.

Why Is Twitter Sentiment Analysis important?
Twitter sentiment analysis allows you to listen to your customers and understand what
they need. By introducing sentiment analysis tools into your workflows, you can
automatically organize unstructured information (which includes Twitter data) in real-
time, at scale, and accurately:
* Scalability: Analyze hundreds or thousands of tweets mentioning your brand
and automate manual tasks.
* Business: In marketing field companies use it to develop their strategies, to
understand customers&#39; feelings towards products or brand, how people respond
to their campaigns or product launches and why consumers don&#39;t buy some
products.
* Real-Time Analysis: Twitter sentiment analysis is essential for monitoring
sudden shifts in customer moods, detecting if complaints are on the rise, and for
taking action before problems escalate.
* Politics: In the political field, it is used to keep track of political view, to detect
consistency and inconsistency between statements and actions at the
government level. It can be used to predict election results as well!
* Consistent Criteria: Avoid inconsistencies that stem from several agents
tagging data against different criteria. Instead, train a machine learning model to
perform sentiment analysis, using one set of rules, on all your Twitter data, so
results are consistent.
* Public Actions: Sentiment analysis also is used to monitor and analyse social
phenomena, for the spotting of potentially dangerous situations and determining
the general mood of the blogosphere.
