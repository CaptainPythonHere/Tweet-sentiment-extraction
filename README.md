 Twitter Sentiment Analysis with Machine Learning
# Introduction
In recent years, a huge number of people have been attracted to social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram etc. People use social sites to express their emotions, beliefs or opinions about things, places or personalities. It's not only people expressing their views, but social media has evolved to a greater dimension where brands, politicians, journalists, influencers all co-exists together with different agendas like promoting products/ideologies, entertaining people, demanding justice and whatnot. 
As the title suggests in this project we are going to do Tweet Sentiment Analysis. Sentiment Analysis is the process of 'computationally' determining whether a piece of writing is positive, negative or neutral. It's also known as opinion mining, deriving the opinion or attitude of a speaker. 
As of Q1 2019, Twitter has over 336 million monthly active users (MAU) worldwide as compared to 321 million in Q4 2018 and 326 million for Q3 2018. Interestingly, every month, roughly 500 million people access Twitter without logging in.

Going by some statistics HERE is the reason why we choose twitter over other platforms:
•	Worldwide, Twitter has over 336 million monthly active users and 100 million daily active users.
•	23% of the Internet population is said to be on Twitter.
•	Top 5 countries on Twitter accounts for 50% of overall Tweets.
•	2 billion Queries are served by Twitter on a daily basis.
•	83% of the World's Leaders have Twitter accounts.
•	There are 24.6% verified Journalists on Twitter.
•	77% brands feel positive upon a Tweet that's been replied to.
•	58% of the top brands on Twitter have more than 10k followers.
•	95% of companies post one or more Tweet in a day.
•	India has over 34.4 million monthly active users on Twitter.

Growth in the area of opinion mining and sentiment analysis has been rapid and aims to explore the opinions or text present on different platforms of social media through machine-learning techniques with the sentiment, subjectivity analysis or polarity calculations. 
we will use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to make sense of human language, and machine learning to automatically deliver accurate results.
